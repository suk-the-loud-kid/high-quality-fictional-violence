            All conspiracy theorists strut around in suits, puffing themselves up.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they spot each other, they recognize one another instantly and greet each other politely,
        </p>
        <p>
            but to the people making their coffee, they respond curtly as if they can't be bothered, walking off into the distance before the ordering even ends, as if wishing the moment would end as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            They shove their cards in your face, point fingers, speak daggers, and get flustered when you don't remember their usual. They shove their hands in their pockets, thrust out their chests as far as they can, and expect you to intuit everything they want with just a single word. They pile trash endlessly onto the tiny space right next to the trash can,
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            and then walk away.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Why do people <br>
            believe that <br>
            dead people <br>
            just vanish somewhere, <br>
            and another person <br>
            automatically appears in their place?
        </p>

        <p>
            All conspiracy theorists
        </p>
        <p>
            believe there is another world beneath their one,
        </p>
        <p>
            and that everyone who came from that world is a conspiracy theorist.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Therefore, they must be dismembered, stoned, buried alive, and sent back to where they came from, wherever that may be.
        </p>

            A limping wizard we met at the Melange Highway Motel shouted at young people drunk by the campfire, talking about hope and the future:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Hey, you shit-heads! Nobody in this world wants us!
        </p>

        <p>
            And you replied:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. “Yeah! So we gotta kill every last one of those bastards who look down on us!” → Go to A
        </p>
        <p>
            2. “No, it's not true! The world is getting better!” → Go to B
        </p>
        <p>
            3. “Of course it is. Look at us. Even I would turn my back on these fools.” → Go to C
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            4. You say nothing and silently continue drinking. → Go to D
        </p>

        <p><b>A.</b></p>
        <p>
            You returned to the city dreaming of revenge, but found no redemption for your soul. Too many debts remained unpaid, and to repay them while living like a human being, you had to work until every joint was infected.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, you worked until you felt nothing anymore,
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            then choked to death on your own vomit in your room.
        </p>

        <p><b>B.</b></p>
        <p>
            You gained various companions on this journey. You call them comrades, but truthfully, they care little for you. They only value your existence when you agree with their agenda and fight for their cause. They only find you beautiful when you are insane.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are right. The world is getting better.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            But you are not one of them.
        </p>

        <p><b>C.</b></p>
        <p>
            You actually get along well with your parents. When you're starving to death, or even if things aren't quite that dire, you can get some money from your parents. And with that money, you scrape by for days at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            And you feel ashamed of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            And when you meet someone whose children carry a more primal sorrow than your resentment toward your parents, you feel flustered. And you find all those people disgusting.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            And you’re proud of that.
        </p>


        <p><b>D.</b></p>
        <p>
            So you sit huddled in a corner of your motel room, small, smelly, trash piled up, sounds of someone making love or shouting or honking a horn coming from the wall beyond,
        </p>
        <p>
            murmuring truths that only come out when you're drunk or drowsy,
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            and then you fall asleep wishing you could just slip into death like this and never wake up again the next day, or the day after that.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            But the wizard can bring the dead back to life <br>
            to the place where they always were <br>
            as if they never left in the first place <br>
            so everyone can see us again
        </p>

        <p>
            But that night, the wizard downed painkillers, literally, until he dropped in his motel room,
        </p>
        <p>
            and we scattered, forced back to our jobs where conspiracy theorists ignore us, where they buy coffee, books, cigarettes, sandwiches, or burgers from us.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Those people seemed unaware I'd even disappeared.
        </p>

        <p>Actually, thinking about it now,</p>
        <p>everything that wizard said was bullshit.</p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah, it was totally a conspiracy theory.</p>
        <p>He was better off dead.</p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah, he was better off dead.</p>
        <p>If I'd known it would turn out like this, I should've just died with him back then.</p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah.</p>
        <p>Someone else will fill our spots anyway.</p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="terminal01">Yeah.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="terminal01">(Yeah.)</p>
