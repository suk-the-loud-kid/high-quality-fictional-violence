            It's okay, because I
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            flicker only alive in moments, from the start, don't let anyone look in, nor wait or expect anything.
        </p>

        <p>Hell is already here</p>
        <p>Every place we step is hell</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Because we're already dead people.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            So tell that crazy cultist, that tight-ass bastard, to stay the hell away from this area!
        </p>

        <p>
            But in my pocket, still
        </p>
        <p>
            That tight-ass bastard's crumpled business card was tucked away
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            When I pulled it out and unfolded it, funny words were written there
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">ㅈㅣ금 당장 연락주쎒ิิ</p>

        <p>They say if you die inside a cup, you become a ghost</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Then we can start over</p>

        <p>If I start over, I'll</p>
        <p>
            expect more, hope more, love more, live more, strive more, laugh more, cry more, work more, explore more, study more, enjoy more, meet more people, hate more, resist more, live a more meaningful life, be remembered longer, wider, and properly.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Then meeting that tight-ass again and getting exorcised once more is my goal.
        </p>

        <p>
            And when I die again, you'll be by my side, right?
