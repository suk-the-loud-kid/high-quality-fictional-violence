        <p>
            The setting is a small, modern apartment on a dark, old street. A light emitting a yellow glow is turned on above a small, tall wooden table. Shadows fall over the faces of two people. The two shadows are perched on a mattress. The mattress is stained yellow with grime, and dried bloodstains are pressed into it, giving off a musty smell.
        </p>
        <p>
            A muffled song drifts in from the neighbor's room through the bathroom vent. The only discernible word is “Sigarette.” Rain falls outside the window.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a plate with a chipped edge sits spaghetti Bolognese. A glass, still bearing water spots, is filled to the brim with sparkling water. A fork scrapes across the plate, gathering pieces of meat and sauce-coated spaghetti strands together. The two eat the spaghetti for a long while without speaking. Still, the sound of the fork scraping the plate. One of them picks up the glass and gulps down the sparkling water. Now, about half of the sparkling water remains in the glass. They continue eating spaghetti. The fork scrapes the plate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the vent, a man<a class="footnote04" href="#" onclick="toggleText01()" id="readMoreLink">[1]</a> keeps searching for a pack of cigarettes.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote04" id="moreText01">
            The man was a Koryo-saram who had led a rock band in Leningrad. His fans pay tribute to him by placing cigarettes in the ashtrays placed on the street below.
        </span>

        <p style="margin-top: 4rem;">
            Outside the window, detectives chase a fleeing criminal:
        </p>
        <p>
            Parasites of society who dare threaten the safety of decent, law-abiding citizens. Psychopaths who stab people with knives and feel no guilt. Drunks who walk naked through the streets, piss against walls, and invite scorn. Opportunists who sell blood instead of money to join gambling rings. Frankenstein's rag-tag monsters who crave cutting off and reattaching genitals, arms, and legs. Fake women who offer each other their breasts to suckle.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the neighbors in the apartment building.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Families.
        </p>


        <p><b>NORMAL GUY</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">I never thought I'd be on a date in a place like this.</p>

        <p><b>WEIRD PERSON</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Don't worry. The rain should stop soon.</p>

        <p><b>NORMAL GUY</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Do you always eat this for dinner?</p>

        <p><b>WEIRD PERSON</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">It's cheap, isn't it?</p>


        <p>
            Outside the front door, junkies are shouting, screaming, and laughing in the hallway. A man dressed like a woman presents a bouquet to a woman dressed like a man. She sniffs the flowers and bursts into loud, raucous laughter. The whole hallway echoes. They laugh until tears stream down their faces, then slam the door loudly and enter their apartment.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            NORMAL GUY stops scraping his fork against the plate at the sound and looks at the front door.
        </p>

        <p><b>WEIRD PERSON</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Don't mind them. They’re like this every time they go on a date.</p>

        <p>
            The shadow of the WEIRD PERSON knocks the NORMAL GUY<a class="footnote04" href="#" onclick="toggleText02()" id="readMoreLink">[2]</a> onto the mattress and sits on top of him.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote04" id="moreText02">
            NORMAL GUY, upon seeing the strange body, feels compelled to kiss it and worship it. He wants WEIRD PERSON to stab his belly with a knife and strangle him. He craves a very unique and bizarre experience. He wants to feel special.
        </span>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            The plate is covered in sauce stains, the glass filled with water marks. Beyond the light, a sticky wooden floor forms a glistening reflection. In the darkness beyond the reflection's reach, NORMAL GUY  feels the strange body. Short, neatly rounded nails and the rounded flesh beneath them scratch across skin covered in bumpy scars piled like snow.
        </p>
        

        <p><b>NORMAL GUY</b></p>
        <p>I love you just the way you are.</p>
        <p>(pause)</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">You're a good person.</p>

        <p><b>WEIRD PERSON</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">(silence)</p>

        <p>
            NORMAL GUY tenderly kisses WEIRD PEROSN’s deer-antler-shaped scar above breasts. Detectives chase a criminal into the apartment building. They knock on an iron door beside a narrow, old elevator. A junkie, gambling, opens the door<a class="footnote04" href="#" onclick="toggleText03()" id="readMoreLink">[3]</a>. The detectives strike his head with a very hard baton, knock him to the floor, and handcuff him. The gamblers all simultaneously draw knives, but when the detective aims his gun, they all drop to the floor. Like corpses. Like fish scooped out of water.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote04" id="moreText03">
            It was his turn then. The residents of the apartment look out for each other and take responsibility for one another. They don't ask questions carelessly or pry into each other's private lives. Even if someone makes a foolish mistake, they embrace each other.
        </span>
        <p>
            Knocks sound one by one on doors, and the neighbors hiding inside are dragged out one by one, seized by the back of the neck by the detectives. The junkie who received the bouquet weeps so hard her eyes turn black. A serial killer, mid-call with his lover in a distant land, is silent while his lover keeps screaming his name<a class="footnote04" href="#" onclick="toggleText04()" id="readMoreLink">[4]</a> over the receiver. The detectives shout:
        </p>
        <span class="footnote04" id="moreText04">
            It was also his father's name.
        </span>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Monsters who dare disturb the peace of decent people. Psychopaths who feel no guilt for their existence. Drunkards who live and die for booze and drugs, devoid of love, romance, or humanity. Selfish opportunists who crave respectability even in filthy clothes. Fake women and fake men who shove each other's genitals into their mouths
        </p>

        <p>
            and
        </p>
        <p>
            WEIRD PERSON
        </p>
        <p>
            smashes the detective's head with this water-stained glass.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Another detective strikes WEIRD PEROSN’s head with a very hard rod.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two tangle together and fall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blood pools on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
            A neighbor with hair grown to his knees, a bulging belly, and a shaved lower body stabs the detective in the back again and again with a large knife.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            NORMAL GUY watches the front door from inside the house.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then the neighbors unlocked the handcuffs on each other's wrists and pulled at the detectives' limbs and necks. We can join this week's gambling game, they say. This should easily feed our kids for a week, they say. This works just fine for my entertainment, they say. The sound of flesh being torn and cut by saws, kitchen knives, and chipped liquor bottles is drowned out by the neighbors' laughter.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Harmonious.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            A strange person returns home carrying a bouquet of flowers.
        </p>

        <p><b>NORMAL GUY</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">You're bleeding.</p>

        <p><b>WEIRD PERSON</b></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">It stopped raining. Want me to open the window?</p>

        <p>
            Standing by the window, light falls across the face.
        </p>
        <p>
            A face of neither woman nor man reaches out with a hand of neither woman's nor man's and opens the window. The bouquet falls before the mattress and crumbles. A faint floral scent settles over the musty mold odor. And from beyond the window frame, the smell of the seashore drifts in. Beyond the vent, the man is still searching for cigarettes. A grandma tosses a cigarette butt into a glass half-filled with whiskey, then falls asleep.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            The squeaking sound of the mattress begins to seep out beyond the vent.
        </p>

        <p>
            The setting is a house where families live.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neighbors each simmer some stew for dinner, listen to songs, ask what kind of day it was, wipe blood on the floor, turn on the TV to watch news about vanished criminals, and bury the mattress sound deep inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you still love me? Of course. Would you love me even if I stabbed someone to death? Absolutely. Would you still love me if thugs cut off my arm? I'll kiss on the scars. Now strangle me. Your dry face smells like salty seawater. Spit on me so I can get wet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The muffled sound of Mom, Dad, and their daughter chatting happily over dinner drifts in. The man no longer searches for cigarettes. Grandmother has fallen asleep, the detectives have bitten the dust, and the neighbors sit around the round wooden table again, drawing cards. They clink their glasses together and shout.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem; font-style: italic;">

        <p>Outside the window, the yellow light goes out.</p>
        <p>Blackout.</p>
