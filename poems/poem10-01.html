            Our previous generation of cowboys all blinded themselves with wealth and glory, either destroying themselves or awaiting their end. You were trained by the most capable cowboy among the survivors. Yet you have no successor. For you are still young, and our generation is already nearing its end.
        </span>
        <p>
            You have raced tirelessly from a place far, far away to settle a long-standing grudge.
        </p>
        <p>
            That place lies to the north, bitterly cold, and most people don't even know its name. No one cares about the names of those who lived there or what their lives were like. Only you remember.

            At the end of this maze, they toss out false hope like rotten bait, claiming you'll finally meet your loved ones again, while the voices of the powerful cackle away. There's no time to pay them any mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no nobility in your actions.

            Chewing soggy cereal, staring at the missing child ad on the side of a faded cereal box like a mirror, while the TV crackles with static and news of street gangs gunned down in a mass killing plays. Beyond the creaking, rusted window, the sound of old blues music drifts in, along with someone on the phone saying her husband might be cheating.
        </p>
        <p>
            You were born and raised in the city, but you long for that snowy countryside village.

        <p>
            The setting is an old apartment.
        </p>
        <p>
            You wake up<a class="footnote10" href="#" onclick="toggleText02()" id="readMoreLink">[2]</a> as someone whispers. Even in your dazed state, you recognize that voice.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote10" id="moreText02">
            You were dreaming of a very distant future. A scene where all the people you love gather around to celebrate your birthday. A moment when you look down or up at the night view of the city where you were born and raised, exhaling cigarette smoke with the wind. And you meet all those people you've longed for your entire life again, lying back-to-back on a snow-swept apartment rooftop, gazing up at that sky or looking down. When you close your eyes, the ending credits begin to roll up or down.
        </span>

        <p style="margin: 4rem 0 4rem 0;">
            Happy birthday.
        </p>

        <p>
            And beneath a small flame sits a single candle, placed atop a small, humble slice of chocolate pie.
        </p>
        <p>
            You blow out the flame with your breath and make a wish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, as if the voice in the darkness had secretly read your mind, it smiles and whispers again.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 4rem 0 4rem 0;">
            Don't worry. <br>
            I'll <br>

            here <br>
            until <br>

            In the middle of the desert, a building lies half-collapsed and abandoned. It's called the Melange Highway Motel. All sorts of fugitives and undocumented immigrants gather there, hiding and living together. Their faces never appear in missing person ads or on the news. Everyone who remembers them has grown old and died. They live where no one pursues them. You once stayed here briefly, chasing a prey.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have lost as much as you, many times over. Their lives have been torn up by the roots and replanted in new soil countless times, yet they do not resent their existence. Sometimes, unable to stand straight out of bed, they drown themselves in drink. But once sufficiently drunk, they gather in a circle, sing songs, and somehow unravel their blurred memories to talk about moments that were good, sad, terrible, and so funny.
        </p>
        <p>
            You feel a guilt that you too should have become like this.
        </p>
        <p>
            You could have just lived.
        </p>

            In fact, <br>
            you couldn't.

            Your long-held resentment, your fleeting despair, and your pathetic clinging to another ending even when everything is over has made you miserable.
        </span>
        <p>
            You have completed your journey and returned home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone welcomes you and asks how you’re holding up. Fresh flowers lie piled upon the grave of your beloved, and beside it stand countless tombstones of nameless victims<a class="footnote10" href="#" onclick="toggleText04()" id="readMoreLink">[4]</a>.

            You remember all their names. But none of them made it into the records. You are the last cowboy of our generation, the protagonist of this story, but to them, you were just a minor extra of little significance. All the people who played those roles have already stepped out of this story and are living their daily lives at ease. No one thinks deeply about this story anymore, and frankly, no one cares.
        </span>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Even though all vengeance is done, he does not return, and you cannot be saved. There is no cathartic ending to fill the stale emptiness. You killed all the cowboys of the generation before you. Now, in this world, there is no more violence, no more death, no more cycle feeding on someone's grudge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kneeling before the grave, or lying on the ground covered in a thin layer of snow, gazing up at the sky or looking down, you murmur. I'm back. There is no answer to returning. I'm sorry for leaving you. But now I came back to you. From now on, we can stay together forever. Until the end. And you realize this story has reached its end.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you still dwell on all those possibilities and the reasons you could never resolve your heart. The one who lived gnawing at themselves makes one last desperate struggle. Finally, the words that lingered on your lips all along burst out.

            No one stayed seated to watch this story to the end. As always, you are alone from this moment on.
