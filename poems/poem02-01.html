        <p>After finally quitting alcohol and painkillers, now I can't sleep without melatonin.</p>
        <p>And there are things I remembered before falling asleep.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 4rem;">I always pretended to like the art films you loved,</p>
        <p>But the truth is, I was always dozing off next to you in the theater.</p>
        <p>Even as the end credits rolled,</p>
        <p>I felt nothing.</p>
        <p>You acted like your twisted desires were some kind of “real” aesthetic,</p>
        <p>So I always watched gore films with you too,</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">But every time entrails appeared on screen, I felt like throwing up.</p>

        <p>Though countless comrades revealed their true selves in the square,</p>
        <p>there's still no place for us.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">We saved the world, yet the world pushes us away.</p>

        <p>At times like that</p>
        <p>just</p>
        <p>in the shadows</p>
        <p>shoot</p>
        <p>the gun</p>
        <p>like this</p>
        <p>speaking</p>
        <p>in broken</p>
        <p>sentences</p>
        <p>slowly</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">calmly</p>

        <p>Crawling through the room</p>
        <p>A spider from within the flower</p>
        <p>Blue light illuminates the red room</p>
        <p>A woman who realized long ago angels never come</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">screams a warning of reunion</p>

            This is one of the spam texts that started flooding in South Korea at some point. The “nostalgia” evoked by this text went viral because it reminded people of the game Animal Crossing and the movie Past Lives, and it has now solidified as one of the memes.

        <p style="margin-top: 4rem;">We're all fucked.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">But that's okay.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">At least we knew we'd die soon.</p>

        <p>Goodbye</p>
        <p>Yeah, sorry</p>
