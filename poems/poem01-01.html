        <p class="text-tap">to my friend:</p>
        <p class="text-tap">shall i tell you a secret?</p>
        <p class="text-tap">truth is, i’m not myself<a class="footnote01" href="#" onclick="toggleText01()" id="readMoreLink">[1]</a>.</p>
        <p class="text-tap">and there’s a dog outside the house.</p>
        <span class="footnote01" id="moreText01">
          Long ago, someone dug through a mound of earth in the forest and climbed out upside down.
        </span>

        <p>
          Because someone had snitched on, my parents dug up the entire yard and finally found the dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          It looked exactly like a rat, crawling on all fours with wings, but it couldn't fly because it had starved for so long Its body was covered in wounds as if many people had surrounded it in a circle kicking it from above downwards It was as if it had always been meant to be treated that way as if no one cared about it at all. Transparent, like a real angel.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
          It was disgusting, repulsive, ugly, and hideous, yet strangely, I couldn't look away. There was something oddly compelling about it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The angels crawl on all fours across the floor, walls, and ceiling, vomiting up everything they've eaten and drunk while confessing their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still remember what they’ve been telling me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish you were here, I don't know when I'll be able to go there, but when I do, I'll love you even more, thank you for coming to find me, I'll always be waiting here for you, You are part of my happiness, let's stay happy together from now on, I want to be in the same season soon, the sky was so blue it made me think of you, I hope you aren't too lonely, don't worry about me, you should always be happy until we meet again.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
          But I've always thought they found me and left me for that.
        </p>

        <p>
          The detective, holding the body of that child savior with a bullet hole in her head, mutters that they might have become a family.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            And it’s still snowing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Supporting the ceiling with both hands,
        </p>
        <p>
          I lay down under the bed, imagining the future<a class="footnote01" href="#" onclick="toggleText02()" id="readMoreLink">[2]</a> I would have one day.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote01" id="moreText02" style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
          They saw people passing through the wind and swaying trees, and followed them down to the city, and in the process ate an old man in the neighborhood who pointed a finger at them.
        </span>

        <p>
          A very large and empty house or a living room flooded with sunlight or a wide empty bed or the shadowed space beneath it or wooden furniture that feels soft and rough to the touch or a birthday party where no one comes or nights falling asleep wishing never to wake again.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when I lie in bed and gaze out the terrace, I might witness angels flying by once more.
        </p>
        <p>
          And staring at the ceiling again, I imagine people kicking me from above. I am the eternal victim, and no one respects me. I clearly have wings, but I can never fly. Until someone discovers me and offers unconditional love<a class="footnote01" href="#" onclick="toggleText03()" id="readMoreLink">[3]</a>, feeding me affection until I'm full...
        </p>
        <span class="footnote01" id="moreText03" style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
          Perhaps their name was “fate”.
        </span>

        <p>
            I feel like I’ll have a sweet dream tonight.
        </p>
