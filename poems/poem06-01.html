            Jules runs her fingers through Marc's buzz cut, stiff and scratchy. Marc was already too drunk to care<a class="footnote06" href="#" onclick="toggleText01()" id="readMoreLink">[1]</a>. Jules always wears pink, Marc always wears blue and orange, and Kid always wears black. Whenever Marc happened to wear black, it always looked cooler than whatever Kid was wearing. Jules would console Kid, saying it was because they were so much smaller than Marc. Someday you'll be bigger. Then no one will be able to bully you, she said. And she'd kiss their flat forehead and the cast<a class="footnote06" href="#" onclick="toggleText02()" id="readMoreLink">[2]</a> tightly wrapped around their left hand.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote06" id="moreText01">
            But hasn't it always been that way?
        </span>
        <span class="footnote06" id="moreText02">
            How's it feeling, Kid! Marc once asked them, who was lying in a hospital bed, while shoving a cheap camcorder in their face. They forced their broken hand to twist and gave a thumbs-up.

            The three lived crammed into a studio apartment so worn-down that it wouldn't have been surprising if someone broke in through the door. Most of their belongings were clothes, cigarettes, trash, prescribed estrogen and other unprescribed pills, painkillers you could get anywhere, used syringes mixed together so you couldn't tell whose they were, a few books with meaningless postcards tucked between their pages, posters, receipts for things no one would remember, dust, keychains, and a huge backpack that could hold all of this and let them leave that neighborhood anytime. Combat boots, sneakers, high heels.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Someone smacks their parched lips, wets them, and exhales smoke in measured puffs. Kid scans Marc and Jules' upper bodies. They caress the nuances from shoulder to chest beneath their tight-fitting T-shirts. If they can't have a body like Marc's, then maybe one like Jules' would do, they murmurs to themselves. Across from Marc, who asks if he wants to touch it, Jules chuckles. Afraid they might start making out, Kid gropes Marc's chest, then collapses onto his knees and falls asleep.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the dream, Kid stood between Marc and Jules, their body exactly halfway between them, revealing a chest slightly flatter than that while kissing them. In a room filled with smoke from windows left unopened for days<a class="footnote06" href="#" onclick="toggleText03()" id="readMoreLink">[3]</a>, they groped, embraced, licked, and bit each other, screaming as if possessed.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote06" id="moreText03">
            When the windows are closed, no sound can be heard inside the apartment. Unless it was a siren or gunfire. Once someone fell asleep in that neighborhood, no one else woke until sunrise; if someone couldn't sleep, no one else slept until the next night came. People with nowhere to go always slept on the streets, and those who had a place never paid them any mind. When Kid was one of those people, Mark and Jules brought them to their place to sleep.

            And finally, when all the sweat they'd shed cooled, Marc and Jules hugged each other with Kid's body between them. Jules whispered as she carefully slipped her fingers between Kid's splayed joints. You'll grow more here, Kid. I promise. Kid, already drunk beyond measure, kept silent like an oath<a class="footnote06" href="#" onclick="toggleText04()" id="readMoreLink">[4]</a>.

        <p style="margin-top: 4rem;">
            The tail end of dawn. As the sun began to rise, Kid opened their eyes and headed for the bathroom. One person could barely fit inside, unable to fully stretch their arms. And they imagined looking into the mirror and shaving their head into a buzz cut. Their shoulders would broaden, their legs lengthen, their face grow gaunt, their chest flatten. Then someone would open the bathroom door, pull them close, whisper tender words, and stroke their prickly head for a long while.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            <!-- 들여쓰기 -->
            And water seeping into their cast made them awkwardly shake their arm, and they looked away from the mirror. Outside the door, Jules and Marc's voices drift in from afar.
        </p>

        <p>Kid will be fine!</p>
        <p>What if they die!</p>
        <p>I said they'll be fine! Kid can handle being alone!</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Marc, you never know what he'll do if left alone!</p>

        <p>
            Kid imagines themselves opening the window, leaping out, and climbing onto the rooftop. A bird with a buzz cut spreads its wings, catching the fierce wind. It seemed like it wouldn't matter if the sun beat down or rain poured down. After all, it has a home to return to, and it'll keep growing no matter what. Then no one will ever look down on it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- 들여쓰기 -->
            But just as they noticed no sound was coming from outside the door anymore, Kid realized they had opened the door and returned to the room where the two were. Marc and Jules looked afraid that Kid might have heard their words. They swept the hair flowing down their forehead and cheekbones back.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not like that.
        </p>

            The three stared at each other for a long moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s night again. The three crunch painkillers and down cheap vodka. Jules in purple, Marc in deep orange, and Kid in black lie side by side on the rug, staring at the ceiling. Jules wraps an arm around Kid, resting her head in the space between their jaw and shoulder. Marc extends one arm to offer Kid a place to rest their head. Kid murmurs a thought they’ve held for a very long time, without realizing it.

            What if I really am like that?

        <p>
            And silence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- 들여쓰기 -->
            Will I end up falling asleep alone again someday?
        </p>
        <p>
            Silence again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- 들여쓰기 -->
            It's okay. I never really fit in with you guys anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jules pulls them closer and whispers. That's not true. We love you. Really. We'll never leave your side. And from the other side, Marc's whispering. You're already a grown man, Kid. Don't cling to us too much. Even if we leave, you have to keep living. And someday, you'll be okay too<a class="footnote06" href="#" onclick="toggleText05()" id="readMoreLink">[5]</a>.
        </p>
        <span class="footnote06" id="moreText05">
            Never mentioned it to anyone, but Kid always knew. That they would leave them someday, anyway. That someday they would be left alone again. What they hadn't known was that the various parts of them they had simply torn away had burrowed too deep inside them, destined to stir their insides for the rest of their life. And that they had taken nothing from them. So in the end, the shame would feel bigger than the loss.
        </span>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Kid thinks about curling up face-down and crying because their left arm throbs again.
        </p>

        <p>
            And exactly two months later, when Jules and Marc leave their place to pursue their own dreams and loves, they will grow up even on the frozen city streets at night. As if it wouldn't matter whether the sun blazed down or rain poured down. They shake their left arm free from the cast and flops onto the snow. They wait for someone to caress their head. Marc, Jules, or others who came before the<a class="footnote06" href="#" onclick="toggleText06()" id="readMoreLink">[6]</a>. Then, Kid would really, truly be okay.

            “But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.” He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance. — Shelley, Mary. (1818). Frankenstein. Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor & Jones.

            But would that even matter?

            So they grabs a handful of their hair with right hand and pull it out.
