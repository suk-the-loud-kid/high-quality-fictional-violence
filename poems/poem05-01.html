  <body class="bg01">
    <div class="container" style="left: 0; top: 20%; width: 400px; height: 400px;">
        <p>
            The spotlight shines.
        </p>
        <p>
            The setting is a snow-covered front yard.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Armed police and soldiers aim their guns, and David is whispering something to me (It's okay. Everything will be okay. This is all a dream. This is all a lie, and it's not real. This isn't reality. In reality, we're very happy people. We live together in a sunny house on the outskirts, not far from the city. In the morning, we wake up, drink coffee, and go to work. Those boring, tiring, but ordinary, manageable jobs that very ordinary people do. Then, when evening comes, we return home, hug each other, whisper words of love, and fall asleep together. We're living the dream of those people. So it's okay. Everything will be okay...). I listen to his voice flowing into my head from far away and pull him close.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            (I didn't like him like a boyfriend. <br>
            I just felt so fucking sorry for him like I was sorry for myself, and I couldn't stop worrying about him...)
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            This time, the spotlight illuminates hot pink wallpaper, white window frames, and the dark mahogany wood furniture. The wall sags and bulges along the shape of handprints, and the clutter on the desk shakes and rattles.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the sun-drenched bedroom, a scene follows of short nails scratching bare skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            You know who'd be perfect to call on a happy day like today? Your mom. You always liked your mom, didn't you? You said even if the whole world hated you, she'd never resent you. So let's call her today.
        </p>
        <p>
            (David, this isn't fun anymore. I want to stop.)
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            I watch as the spotlight slowly falls over David's face and clamp my eyes shut.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            Some days David starts mummering as he stubs out his cigarette on the pile of dirty dishes. I listen to his whole story, recalling how he held me in his arms last night. Blue lights slowly sweep back and forth across the room. Our bedroom clearly has no windows, yet it feels like sunlight once streamed in. I watch this whole scene unfold, while he’s repeating what he said, while staring down at the terrible dish he made.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            (Yeah, you’re the only one fucking suffering here, right?)
        </p>

        <p>Truth is, I'm not a good person.</p>
        <p>I've been lying to you all this time.</p>
        <p>I don't want to be happy.</p>
        <p>
            I'd rather make everyone as miserable as I am. I want to crush everyone's lives, weigh them down with guilt and paranoia until they can't tell right from wrong. I want to hunt down every single one who tries to run away from me. I want them to live their whole lives trembling in fear. I want them to feel, right up until the moment they die, that they'll never be free, never loved.
        </p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Yeah, that's what I really want.</p>

        <p>
            I remember the days David and I lay naked in bed, playing mommy and baby. He could have made my useless breasts disappear with a single gesture anytime, but he loved burying his head between them, crying and whining like a baby, so he showed me no mercy.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
            I often wished I had a huge cock instead of breasts. Then, whenever David acted so irritatingly, I could just ram it in and be done with it... Then, as a man, I could make David's mother happy as a woman, and maybe she wouldn't have raised David into such a pitiful creature…
        </p>

        <p>You always listen to me.</p>
        <p>You're such a good person.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Suddenly, David's voice whispers in my ear.</p>

        <p>And a spotlight begins to fall upon our faces.</p>
